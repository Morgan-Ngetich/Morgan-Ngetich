## 🧠 Experience  
Technical lead in scalable uncertainty at the Institute of Continuous Deployment and Questionable Life Choices™.  
Built payment systems, multiplayer prototypes, and SaaS platforms no one asked for but everyone uses.  
Once deployed to prod on a Friday. Twice. Still here.

## 📚 Currently Learning  
- Rust (because therapy is expensive)  
- FastAPI & distributed architectures that break in new, exciting ways  
- CI/CD, Docker, OpenShift — basically DevOps cosplay  
- “Force Push and Pray” — with emotional support commit messages  
- Rats (real ones — they’ve seen my code and stayed)  
- How to look busy on Zoom while reading Stack Overflow threads from 2012

---

## ⚙️ Stack  
Python • Rust • TypeScript • FastAPI • Redis • Docker • Bash (and bad decisions)  
Vue & React — not by choice, but by fate  
YAML & crying — frequently together  

---

## 🫠 Known Issues  
- Haven’t slept since the last prod incident  
- Git history reads like a diary of regret  
- My local branch is 87 commits ahead *and behind*  
- I’ve been debugging for 3 days. The bug was a missing `:`  
- I build scalable systems. I cannot, however, scale my emotions.
